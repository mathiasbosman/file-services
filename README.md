# üóÉÔ∏è File Services

[![Build and analyze](https://github.com/mathiasbosman/file-services/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mathiasbosman/file-services/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This package holds some simple interfaces to use certain file services.

## Supported services

Currently, the library supports:

- [NIO (new IO) systems](#NIO-file-system)
- [Amazon S3 systems](#S3-file-system)

## Setup

Setting up a file service is as simple as calling its constructor and passing the file system to be
used.

### NIO file system

Every NIO (new IO) system (`java.nio.file.FileSystem`) can be used.

To initiate you can pass both the system and the root path. The system can be left out in which
case `FileSystems.getDefault()` will be used.

```java
private final FileService fileService=new NIOFileService(nioSystem,"path/to/root");
// or
private final FileService fileService=new NIOFileService("path/to/root");
// which is the same as
private final FileService fileService=new NIOFileService(FileSystems.getDefault(),"path/to/root");
```

### S3 file system

To set up a file service that uses Amazon's S3 file system provide the S3-system as well as the
bucket name:

```java
private final FileService fileService = new S3FileSystem(s3, "bucketName");
```

To create an Amazon S3 file system the provided static factory method can be used:

```java
AmazonS3 s3=AmazonS3Factory.toAmazonS3(
    "endpointUrl",
    Region.EU_London.toAWSRegion(),
    "key",
    "secret",
    "bucketName",
    true,
    false
    );
    FileService fileService=new S3FileService(s3,"bucket_name");
```
